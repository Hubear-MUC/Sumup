SumUp 1.0
---------

This program sums up numbers you enter.

The use of this came up when I had to sum up several values.

Of course this also could be done with a simple calculator, however I thought this is a good idea for one of these programs here in this progress- project.

Just compile and invoke the program.

It will ask you for entering a number 10 times.

If you want to sum up less than 10 numbers, just enter 0 for every number up to the 10th one.

After entering 10 numbers the program shows the result on the screen.

At the moment 10 numbers is the maximum amount of numbers to be entered. Some code to leave the number entry did not fit into the code space anymore and I did not want to implement a bigger counter than 10 to prevent the user from having to enter dozens or hundreds of zeroes to get the result.
